        <div class="release-text">
          <p>Despite not knowing each other before, electroacoustic composer <strong>Guglielmo Diana</strong> and multidisciplinary artist <strong>Gustavo Cambareri</strong>, aka <em>Lefka</em>, join forces and nicely complement one another via skewed electronics in the third release curated by Neanche Per Sogno.</p>
          <p><strong>NXS003</strong> opens with two tracks composed by Guglielmo Diana, who masterfully creates two magmatic distillations extracted from a maximalist sound palette of field recordings and hard digital processing of concrete samples. Through exhausting micro agglomerations, he forges frenetic visceral narratives that dynamically traverse various emotional states.</p>
          <p>The arrival of Lefka and his distinctive multi-layering oversaturation turns out to be the emotional turning point where two dazzling streams of light, originating from the same sound source, converge blindingly in full spectrum toward the listener's eyes.</p>

        <div class="release-title">Martenot - Faceshopping RMX </div>
        <div class="release-text">
          Originally composed as an acousmatic composition in an extended version for eight channels between 2022 and 2023 during the electroacoustic composition class taught by Professor Stefano Bassanese at the G. Verdi Conservatory of Turin, 'Faceshopping RMX' stemmed from the desire to pay homage to the British producer SOPHIE, a musician who has greatly influenced and inspired Martenot in recent years. The piece consists of a composition that oscillates between a remix and an expanded rework of 'Faceshopping'.

          This work was developed by starting with a matryoshka segmentation of the spectrum of the original track, dividing it vertically, horizontally, or in a hybrid manner into subsections, phrases, fragments, and relevant gestural micro-fragments. Subsequently, after a phase of reverse engineering, numerous related versions were created - at different degrees of proximity - synthesized from scratch using FM and Pulsar synthesis systems, primarily using Supercollider, as well as wavetable synthesis using the Serum plugin. Finally, a significant portion of the obtained signal was manipulated using the Waveset Distortion system, developed in Max/MSP by Marco Marasciuolo, expanding the expressive capacity of each of them in relation to an augmented reformulation of each articulation.

          A wide range of samples was carefully collected and selected, surgically assembled to create a formal architecture that respected the original sequence of sections, at times introducing dramatic variations in content and duration, and at other times emphasizing and amplifying certain original properties - fundamental elements in Martenot's work, concerning the relationship with the source material - such as the digitally hi-tech brutalist, industrial, and hyperkinetic character, as well as the dreamlike imagery resulting from the juxtapositions and overlaps of seemingly incongruous elements.

        <div class="release-title">Martenot - Sfilate Spaziali</div>
        <div class="release-text">
          Italian composer Martenot and founder of Neanche Per Sogno Records unleashes his debut EP called "Sfilate Spaziali", which consists of three pieces entirely based on minimal vocabulary and instrumental apparatus.
          Aiming to exploit the entire musical spectrum, they orbit around a solid sound body, which has as its main source a monophonic synthesizer that he developed in Max/MSP and gives a precise timbre direction with radical aesthetic constraints.
          Each track of the EP stands out from the others both because of the concept that is at its heart, and for the architectural-compositional setting. Each piece, in fact, has its own distinct form, deriving from the polymorphism of processes, from the intersection of these and from the search for an ever new use of the starting sound material.
          However, the feature that unites the three Sfilate Spaziali is the dichotomous alternation of rhythmically tight moments in contrast to more airy and rarefied parts. In the former, the digital material is compressed into a solid rhythmic pattern, almost claustrophobic, which evokes the rigid molecular structures of plastic materials and which leaves no space for action except for the repetition of the various components. In the freer and more rarefied moments, the material expands, gains breath, and reclaims space and air.
